# Project Ttitle
LockThatDown - Mobile Component

# Project Description
The goal of this project is to have an app that generates key pins for door locks.
This app will be used by a locksmith who currently has to manually come up with
different key pins each time he works on a job.

This respository is for the iphone app that will generate key pins for the door locks.
Each time the locksmith works on a lock he'll generate the key pins on the iphone and 
save it on our database. He can retrieve the key pins in the future by looking it up 
from the database using the website interface.There is another respository (https://github.com/ThisTeam404/WebPart)
that holds the website codes.
